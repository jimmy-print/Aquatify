we could also build a model for each user that visits our site and sends in their sentence
the first thing that comes to mind is simply counting the amount of a particular word that they use a lot in their
writing
this can be used to track the amount of water that they consume over a particular period of time, although
it will fail a lot
a pseudonym + ip will be a better solution.

going back to the nlp idea, we could crowdsource data in the form of sentences, then experiment with that data
to see if we can pull information out of it well.

the keywords should also be weighted. (connected heavily with neural networks and the crowdsourcing idea)
for example, take showering as the action type.
shower should weigh more than spend, or minutes
