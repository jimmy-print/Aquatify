user types in sentence for example
i flush the toilet 5 times

passed to server
it scans the sentence for keywords
example_keyword_list = 'toilet', 'urinal', 'drink', 'flush', 'litres', 'times'...

in this sentence we match toilet, flush, and times
thus we can predict what the user is probably indicating, through these combinations
toilet + flush => toilet flush data type, predict unit will be times
times match keywords, 99% (or whatever) probability that user is indicating about toilet flushes and unit is times

statistical model will be interesting, since we will have to build connections between keywords and calculate
the possibility that a sentence belongs to one or the other.

we could also build a model for each user that visits our site and sends in their sentence
the first thing that comes to mind is simply counting the amount of a particular word that they use a lot in their
writing
this can be used to track the amount of water that they consume over a particular period of time, although
it will fail a lot
a pseudonym + ip will be a better solution.

going back to the nlp idea, we could crowdsource data in the form of sentences, then experiment with that data
to see if we can pull information out of it well.

the keywords should also be weighted. (connected heavily with neural networks and the crowdsourcing idea)
for example, take showering as the action type.
shower should weigh more than spend, or minutes
